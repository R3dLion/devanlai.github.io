Iâ€™m a firmware/embedded software engineer working in the Bay Area. I currently work at Davis Instruments as a Senior Firmware Engineer, where I serve as a jack of all trades helping connect weather stations to the internet.

I regularly work on all aspects of firmware, whether it's bringing up a board for the first time, optimizing a device driver, instrumenting the RTOS, or just writing plain old business logic.

I thrive on debugging problems at all layers of the stack. Whether it's a logic analyzer capture or server logs, I avail myself of all troubleshooting information, regardless of the domain. Some days I step through the firmware with the debugger in the morning and step through the companion Android application in the afternoon.

As an engineer at a small company, I solicit design input across team boundaries and strive to make decisions that are best for the product and company as a whole, not just for my own piece of the puzzle. 

## My history

I grew up hacking on Python scripts through high school, mostly writing simple CGI scripts (back when shared hosting was the standard).

In college, I studied [EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley, where I picked up a bit of EE and a lot of CS. After about a semester, I joined [CalSol, the solar vehicle team](https://calsol.berkeley.edu/) for fun because someone promised me cookies.

I ended up spending most of my time at CalSol, where I:

* Built a telemetry system, a couple of times.
* Soldered a few boards, plus a few square meters of solar array.
* [Raced](https://americansolarchallenge.org/the-competition/ascfsgp-2012/) a solar car across 1600 miles on solar power alone.
* Helped design the architecture for the electrical system of the next car.


My days of sanding shell molds and holding up the array are now behind me, but I still keep tabs on the solar car racing community and CalSol.

After graduating, I worked at [Keysight Technologies](https://www.keysight.com/) (formerly known as Agilent, formerly known as Hewlett-Packard) in the High-Frequency Measurements group for four years. While there, I primarily worked on the [UXG series](https://www.keysight.com/en/pcx-x205221/x-series-agile-signal-generators-uxg) of signal generators.


I currently work at [Davis Instruments](https://www.davisinstruments.com/), where I work on weather related products. In my time at Davis, I've:

* Written a partial network stack for the [WeatherLink Live](https://www.davisinstruments.com/weatherlinklive/), including an mDNS responder and DHCP client.
* Put together [Web Bluetooth](https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth/) tools to test device BLE functionality in advance of the mobile application team developing the official mobile app.
* Handled all of the firmware for [AirLink](https://www.davisinstruments.com/airlink/) - a WiFi particulate matter sensor - from concept prototype to initial board bring-up to production programming tools.

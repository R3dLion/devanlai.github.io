title: About me
---

I'm a firmware/embedded software engineer working in the Bay Area. By day, I work on big box RF signal generators. At night, I hack on USB, debuggers, and all things related to microcontrollers.

## My history

I grew up hacking on Python scripts through high school, mostly writing simple CGI scripts (back when shared hosting was the standard).

In college, I studied [EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley, where I picked up a bit of EE and a lot of CS. After about a semester, I joined [CalSol, the solar vehicle team](http://calsol.berkeley.edu/) for fun because someone promised me cookies.

I ended up spending most of my time at CalSol, where I:

* Built a telemetry system, a couple of times.
* Soldered a few boards, plus a few square meters of solar array.
* [Raced](http://americansolarchallenge.org/the-competition/ascfsgp-2012/) a solar car across 1600 miles on solar power alone.
* Helped design the architecture for the electrical system of the next car.


My days of sanding shell molds and holding up the array are now behind me, but I still serve as a general advisor to CalSol.

I currently work at [Keysight Technologies](http://www.keysight.com/) (formerly known as Agilent, formerly known as Hewlett-Packard) as a firmware engineer, working in the High-Frequency Measurements group on signal generator firmware.

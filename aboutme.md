I'm a firmware/embedded software engineer working in the Bay Area. By day, I work on weather stations. By night, I tinker with debuggers.

## My history

I grew up hacking on Python scripts through high school, mostly writing simple CGI scripts (back when shared hosting was the standard).

In college, I studied [EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley, where I picked up a bit of EE and a lot of CS. After about a semester, I joined [CalSol, the solar vehicle team](http://calsol.berkeley.edu/) for fun because someone promised me cookies.

I ended up spending most of my time at CalSol, where I:

* Built a telemetry system, a couple of times.
* Soldered a few boards, plus a few square meters of solar array.
* [Raced](http://americansolarchallenge.org/the-competition/ascfsgp-2012/) a solar car across 1600 miles on solar power alone.
* Helped design the architecture for the electrical system of the next car.


My days of sanding shell molds and holding up the array are now behind me, but I still keep tabs on the solar car racing community and CalSol.

After graduating, I worked at [Keysight Technologies](http://www.keysight.com/) (formerly known as Agilent, formerly known as Hewlett-Packard) in the High-Frequency Measurements group for four years. While there, I primarily worked on the [UXG series](https://www.keysight.com/en/pcx-x205221/x-series-agile-signal-generators-uxg) of signal generators.


I currently work at [Davis Instruments](https://www.davisinstruments.com/), where I work on weather station receiver firmware.
